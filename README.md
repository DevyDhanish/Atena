### ✨ What is *atena*?

**atena** is a smart, lightweight AI assistant that silently runs on top of your screen, listens to desktop audio, sees your screen in real-time, and generates **context-aware answers**
---

### 💡 Core Features

🔊 **Desktop Audio Analysis**   
Listens to everything your system hears — YouTube videos, meetings, lectures, etc.  
Detects speech, understands intent, and reacts.

🖥️ **Visual Awareness**  
Captures your screen (non-invasively) and understands what you’re looking at.

🧠 **Real-time AI Responses**  
Generates useful answers, summaries, or suggestions based on what you hear and see.

🧩 **Overlay Mode**  
Sits on top of all windows. Click-through. Transparent. Non-distracting.  

⚡ **Modular Services**  
Microservice-based structure: you choose what you want running — audio, screen, or both.

---

### 🚀 How it works

1. atena launches silently as an overlay.
2. Services are dispatched (audio listening, screen reading).
3. Data is streamed to lightweight AI engines.
4. You get **real-time feedback** or responses without ever lifting a finger.

### 🛠️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/atena
cd atena
create a python env using conda or whatever
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I'll add a script so that it's easy to build.
